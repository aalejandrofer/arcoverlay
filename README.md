## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Application Closes Immediately
**Problem**: The program exits right after launch.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Verify `data` folder exists with all required files
- ✅ Do not run from a temporary location (Downloads folder, inside .zip)

### Hotkeys Don't Work
**Problem**: Pressing configured hotkeys doesn't trigger overlays.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Run application as **Administrator**
  - Right-click shortcut → **Properties** → **Compatibility** → Check "Run as Administrator"
- ✅ Ensure Arc Raiders is running in **Windowed** or **Borderless** mode
- ✅ Check for hotkey conflicts with other applications

### Antivirus False Positive
**Problem**: Antivirus software flags `ArcCompanion.exe` as suspicious.

**Solution**:
- ✅ This is common for PyInstaller-compiled executables
- ✅ Add an exception/exclusion for `ArcCompanion.exe` in your antivirus
- ✅ The application is safe to use

### OCR Not Recognizing Items
**Problem**: Item overlay doesn't appear or shows wrong items.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Ensure game is running at **100% UI scale**
- ✅ Check that tooltip color matches default (adjust in Settings config.ini if needed)
      [OCR]
      target_color = 249, 238, 223 (default setting)
- ✅ Try re-scanning the item with better cursor positioning

### Data Updates Fail
**Problem**: "Check for Updates" button doesn't download new data.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Check your internet connection
- ✅ Ensure firewall isn't blocking the application
- ✅ Try running as Administrator
