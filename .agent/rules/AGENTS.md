+1. After any major change, update the Patchnotes.md file. Only update the section that matches the current version. Maintain a chronological structure (newest at the top) and use clear headers for Added, Changed, Fixed, and Removed. README.md has the current version number.

3. Check with the user before removing any major code or big changes even if on FAST/Agent mode.
