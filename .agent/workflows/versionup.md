description: Increases the version number
---

When trigger increase the version number.

> If the user gave you a number use that number, if not provide the user with the previous number and ask to which version number we shoudl jump to.

Finally, use that number to create a new section in Patchnotes.md and ensure older notes are not modified and modify the version number in the README.md
